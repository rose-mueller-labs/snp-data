# snp-data
1. Create CSV File with metadata and info for the model
2. Models to create
    a. Unsupervised trajectory model to see if there are patterns in trajectory
    b. Supervised SNP or not with Is/Is Not Evolving as Classes => change p-values to find
    best threshold
    c. Create a general model that will work on Is/Is Not Evolving as classes for Stasis data later on
